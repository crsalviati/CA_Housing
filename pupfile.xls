07/08/2016	Stevie - Hound / Labrador Retriever (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Perry, NY	Male	Young	"Posted Breed: Hound / Labrador Retriever (short coat). In order to be considered for adoption we must first have an application on file. Once this is complete we will be in contact with you regarding potential meeting and adopting. If its a dog with lots of interest it can take a few days to review applications. You can expedite this process by ensuring application is answered fully and accurately, and you have given permission for your vet to release information to us. We thank you for your patience and understanding. www.goingtothedogsrescue.org  Stevie was found as a stray and not claimed by an owner, so he is now under our care and looking for his forever home. He appears to be a smaller mixed breed dog with some clear hound ears but a smaller body than that of a lab (maybe beagle/lab? who knows) He is a sweetheart, and a typical playful puppy who is just figuring out the world around him. He gets excited but also loves to snuggle his people. He has already been neutered, microchipped, vaccinated and dewormed so he is ready to find that loving forever home. Stevie's fee is $200 to cover all the medical expenses to get stevie taken care of prior to adoption. Please note you must fill an application on our website www.goingtothedogsrescue.org in order to be considered. Thanks!    Adoption Procedures: We only consider your home for adoption after we receive an application. Once this is complete we then move on in the process to adopting your new best friend. Once we receive an application we review it to see if the particular dog(s) might be a good fit for your home/lifestyle and that you meet the required needs of the dog. Once this is done we proceed to check veterinary references. This is to ensure that pets you have or have had in the past were cared for, altered, and up to date with necessary medical care.  Once you have been through this initial screening we then set up a home visit to ensure that the home is a safe home with little concern about their personality matching yours. We also want to ensure that the home is set up for the same energy levels or medical needs they may or may not have (dog that can't climb stairs, or not enough room to walk, etc.) These steps are important to ensuring that we are finding the proper home for the dog to be FURever! A few requirements of adoption are: *We currently do not adopt out of state unless its a dog that has limited options and has been waiting for an extended period of time in our rescue. In most cases of puppies we have so many applications it makes little sense to transport them out of state when there is plenty of homes in the area that are willing to adopt them. So we have limited our out of state options to those who have less applicants coming in. *Your current pets MUST be spayed/neutered. This would negate our entire mission statement if we did not ensure the safety of all of our dogs and ensure that we are helping to END unnecessary euthanasia due to over breeding/overpopulation. We have made exceptions for severe medical conditions or age that would be too risky. *We do not adopt to homes with smoking indoors due to health concerns for the pets. *Some of our adoptions may require you to be a homeowner, have a fully fenced yard (not invisible fencing) or are required to attend an obedience training class. This is due to the high rate of returns in dogs that are not properly exercised or trained and make it difficult to re-home. Each dog will be properly labeled on the website as to what their needs/requirements may be based on the individual dog. We have been doing this a long time, we hope you understand that we consider the needs of the dogs first and foremost, their best interests are priority #1. Frequently Asked Questions: 1. I applied to adopt a dog but we have an invisible fence not a solid fencing, can we still adopt? -unfortunately invisible fencing is not full proof fencing and does not protect your own dogs from other loose dogs entering your property. Many dogs get out of invisible fencing and then are too afraid to return back to the yard, and there are just too many concerns with the bully breed to put them at risk. Click on article below for more information. Why Invisible Fencing isn't a good solution 2. Do you negotiate on your adoption fees? If I want to take the dog to my own vet for spay/neuter can I get a discount on adoption fees? -Unfortunately 80% or more of our dogs cost hundreds more than we actually adopt them out for. When a dog has a major medical concern the rescue pays out of our adoption funds to get the dog the necessary help it needs to get it to an ""adoptable"" status. We rely heavily on donations and adoption fees to be able to care for these dogs who otherwise would have died, so we are insistant on our fees staying the same in order to continue rescuing future dogs. Without the set fee we are unable to rescue, and cannot afford basic care on dogs. Please understand that very few dogs (even ones that are free to us) are not free....our vets may provide a SMALL discount, but it still cost on average $300-400 to get a dog fully vetted. Our adoption fees are always under this, so as you see it is a loss. If you choose to use your own vet to spay/neuter, we allow that within 30 days of adoption; however we are unable to provide adoption fee discounts due to the reasons stated above. 3. Can I meet the dog before the home visit? Why Can't I take the dog home the day I meet them/fill out an application? -if you wish to meet a dog before the home visit, our suggestion is to attend an adoption event if they are going to be in attendance. The rescue has had numerous situations where people that are not serious about adoption have requested visits to see the dog and then never fill out applications, or set up home visits. We have made the decision that if you take a few moments of your time to do those steps first, it shows your commitment to the dog and we then will proceed to meeting the dogs. This cuts back on many wasted hours for our volunteers who drive all over free of charge to do these meets/home visits. The rescue must be very careful about our adoption process. Unfortunately we do see dog abusers apply, people that have no funding to care for a dog, hoarders, etc. and it is the rescues sole responsibility to ensure the safety of our dogs. We want to be sure that our dogs are going to a home that they will always be provided for and will not be returned. Because of this, we do not allow the dogs to go home upon first meet at an adoption event. We must proceed with vet references and home visits first. 4. Can we adopt more than 1 puppy from a litter? -No, here is an article explaining our position clearly : LITTERMATE SYNDROME 5. Why does it matter what type of training we use and who we take our dog to train with? -Because Training is an unregulated field, sadly many individuals who have had no formal training or keep up on updated standards and practices, this could be potentially dangerous to our dogs. Using inhumane methods such as choke chains, shock collars, prong collars, and ""alpha"" or ""dominance"" based theories are outdated, debunked methodologies that can cause physical and psychological damage to our dogs. Although you have committed to caring for your dog, if you have caused irreparable damage by using these tools and then return the dog we are responsible for this and are not willing to see this done to our dogs. Instead we are able to provide you with a list of excellent recommended trainers who not only are humane and kind, they are always continuing their education to be the best at what they do. Professionals like this are sometimes the best for even the easiest of puppies in order to create a success story for you and your family.

I was surrendered to the city shelter when my owner had to go away for a long time and could no longer take care of me. I was a little nervous at first of what was going on. There were a lot of dogs around me, making all kinds of noise so I was very shy but now I am in a safe home and I even have a foster sister. I am about 1 1/2 years old and weigh 58 pounds. Some of my favorite things are playing with toys, laying on my back in the grass, sitting in the sunshine and being loved on by my foster parents.

Meet HENRY (white) and CHARLIE (Blk/Tan) - Darling adorabull 7 week old male brother Amstaff/Pit Xs. Theyare 8 lbs each of PURE SH*TS AND GIGGLES!!! They were rescued from a neglectful situation and have been thru alot together so they need to stay together. Henry the white boy is deaf, but he's very sensitive and alert and can easily be trained with hand signals. He does rely on his brother so that is another reason why they need to stay together. Henry is shy & coy while Charlie is outgoing and rarin to go! Both pups are sweet, loving and very friendly to all. They are just soo silly, happy go lucky little guys and will make you smile and laugh. Puppies do need lots of attention, structured exercise and training. These guys still need help in the housebreaking dept and will need obedience training and further socialization. Luckily they have each other to chew on and play with so alot of their playful energy will be fulfilled. They seem to be good with other dogs, small and large and since they are pups should be fine with cats. We think they would be best with kids ages 7 yrs+ that can respect their space. We are looking for a home that has had previous large dog experience, preferably with the""bully"" breed and appreciates & understands their needs and will devote the time to make them well mannered dogs and especially to train Charlie with hand signals. If you're the right person/couple/family, your efforts will be doubly rewarded! Come meet/adopt the lovebugs today!! For more info/app; pls email: CECE@TAILSOFLOVERESCUE.ORG                "

07/08/2016	Tanner Pittsburgh - Yellow Labrador Retriever / Shepherd / Mixed (medium coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Cuba, NY	Male	Senior	"Posted Breed: Yellow Labrador Retriever / Shepherd / Mixed (medium coat). I'm About Perfect!Tanner Pittsburgh was born around 8/2/2005 and weighs about 55 pounds. Tanner's family moved and left him behind alone (they said that he was too big for the new home). He survived for days alone with someone possibly coming by to feed him every so often. His only hope was for someone to come and get him out of that situation and that's exactly what happened! His picture and sad story were shared on FB and a volunteer from Joyful Rescues drove several hours to go and rescue him (after arranging the pick up with the family and waiting & waiting for their arrival). We believe that in his prior life, he was a ""lawn ornament"" tied to a dog house, as his elbows are worn down from laying on something hard (certainly not from laying on carpet or furniture)! He is a real ""home-body"", loving being in the house, and prefers to be inside with his people versus outside. We think that he loves being in the house because for the first 11 years of his life he didn't get to be in a real house! Tanner is a wonderful older dog waiting for his forever family. He is housebroken, good with kids, other dogs and cats. He's mellow, easy going and just wants to be with his family. Tanner's great on walks, travels well in cars, sleeps in his doggie bed and makes him self comfortable on the furniture. Although an older dog, he's as good as they get!   The Adoption Fee for this dog is $175.00.   Adoptions fees vary based on adoptability. In general our fees include spay/neuter, all age appropriate vaccines, Home Again micro-chipping & registration, worming & flea control - a ""complete"" pet. We accept CASH or Visa/Mastercard ONLY.    Joyful Rescues has no funding except for our adoption fees and miscellaneous donations. Pet care and vet bills are expensive - you must be ready to take on this financial (as well as emotional) responsibility.   YOU MUST BE AT LEAST 25 YEARS OF AGE TO ADOPT A DOG FROM JOYFUL RESCUES    We keep our pet list as up-to-date as possible. As soon as a pet is adopted, it is removed from the list.

His owners surrendered him to a rescue group. However because he he was too active to live in this foster home of mostly small dogs, we took him into our rescue-foster home in early summer 2011. He has since been offered for adoption on our web site and has had many potential adopters visit him.. However he has not yet found a safe match. He does not seem to have a preference for male or female adopters, but when meeting a couple he seems to be more comfortable with one of them, if at all. He cannot understand why he should take a walk with a ""stranger"".Zak is well adjusted here, affectionate, watchful and VERY playful, Loves to jump and catch water from garden hose. He is still not trusted with small dogs, maybe jealous, or just his herding drive.He does obey when called or given simple commands. In cold upstate NY weather he begs to come in asap. Too inquisitive and ""paws-on"" to roam the house. ""Mouthy"", sometimes even nippy, but he does not bite. But for that reason he is not safe to live with small children, including little neighbors. He needs activity outdoors, loves to patrol his large territory. Although he has access to a river, he does not seem to be interested in swimming, but might jump to follow a person.So it looks like he is a keeper. But we never stop looking, because there might just be a match for him, it is all chemistry.                "

Maya Angelou spent more than four years in a rural Georgia kill shelter, passed over again and again. Perhaps because she wasn't small and fluffy in a place that has very few local adoptions, she sat forgotten despite being ""an amazing dog who gets along with all dogs young and old."" Maya even shared her kennel with others who came to Badass over the years. She kept her charms and somehow managed to stay very loving. Her sweet temperament and enduring Badassery  left an impression last we visited and we are thrilled to say that now she's FREE. She has arrived at her destination full of hope and possesses a tranquility that belies so much time spent unwanted in a noisy shelter. Maya will be coming to Brooklyn after heart worm treatment, but in the meantime she’s accepting applications while getting some much needed rest and relaxation. Apply at http://badassbk.com to foster or adopt her.                "

She was found as a stray but looking at her in these photos speaks volumes as to the torture she has endured in only 5 months of life..  We have named her Lily ....  Lily is suffering from severe skin issues which have caused her little body to become hairless, her face and legs are inflamed and have open sores that have ulcerated ... Lily is also limping on her back right leg which is also causing her severe pain. At this time we do not know the severity of her limp and whether Lilys leg is broken .

07/08/2016	Jasper - Shepherd / Mixed (short coat) Dog For Adoption	rescue	Mutt	Woodside, NY	Male	Baby	"Posted Breed: Shepherd / Mixed (short coat). FOSTER UPDATE: Jasper is a total love-bug who has already stolen his foster parents' hearts with his sweet floppy ears and gorgeous brown eyes. He is the sweetest, gentlest boy who gets along GREAT with other dogs, and walks well on a leash. On occasion he may pull slightly on the leash but responds quickly to correction and then goes back to walking right by your side. Although shy at first, Jasper has a perfectly mellow disposition and it won't take long for him to warm up to you - especially if you give him lots of belly rubs and love! Once he comes out of his shell he blossoms into the sweetest, friendliest boy you'll ever meet - a great companion! Jasper is already house trained and crate trained and you can find him curled up in his crate for a midday nap or when he's ready for bedtime. (But given the opportunity, he wont hesitate to snuggle right up to you on the couch for a good cuddle too!) This super sweet, laid back boy will make a perfect addition to any home where he can get endless love and affection. He's a truly amazing dog who deserves a loving forever home.-------------------Jasper is our gorgeous, 8 years young Shepherd mix who to NYC from a shelter out in Long Island where he just wasn't geting noticed for reasons we simply can't understand. This boy is as sweet as they come! Jasper came to the shelter as a stray with a microchip and they tried many times to contact the person who the chip was registered to, but it lead nowhere. This beautiful boy has known what it feels like to have a home and now is in need of a *true* forever home to rest his head and curl up with his human. Very smart, he already knows the commands ""sit"" and ""paw"", and is treat motivated so further training will go well if you have some treats on hand. Jasper gets along great with other dogs and though he's a little nervous with new people at first, he warms up quickly and then all he wants is love and some pets. Can you give Jasper his second chance at a forever home? Apply now! This dog is available for adoption through Muddy Paws Rescue.
